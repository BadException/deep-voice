This repository contains supporting information and scripts for the Deep Voice neural text to speech system.

The Praat F0 generating script can be run with:

```bash
praat --run scripts/f0-script.praat
```

You will need to edit it and change the input and output directory variables to
get it to work on your dataset.  You will need to install Praat with support
for batch mode.
